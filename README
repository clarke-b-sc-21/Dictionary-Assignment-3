Dictionary Assignment 3

Purpose: The purpose of this porgram is to read a text file and 
build a dictionary of words found in that file. The dictionary will
output the words found in the file as well as the frequency of those
words. The dictionary will not be case sensitive and will have a
max word size and a max allowed number of words. This program will
use an array of strings for its implementation. This one uses linked lists
and a predefined template.



Comments: When I run valgrind there is two allocs 
that are not free'd 

I searched for them for the last hour but did not find them. As 
far as I can tell the destructor i wrote should take of everything but
 valgrind disagrees.

I new my first entry, every following entry, and an entry called temp. 
The first entry and following entries are deleted by my destructor and 
temp is deleted right after the destructor runs. Im missing something.
