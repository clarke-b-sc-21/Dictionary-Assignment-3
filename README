Dictionary Assignment 2

Purpose: The purpose of this porgram is to read a text file and 
build a dictionary of words found in that file. The dictionary will
output the words found in the file as well as the frequency of those
words. The dictionary will not be case sensitive and will have a
max word size and a max allowed number of words. This program will
use an array of strings for its implementation. This one uses strings
and a predefined template.



Comments:The way I wrote the code makes sense and seems like it should work 
but the compiler found several errors. My cpp file still will not compile I was
unable to fix all the errors.
